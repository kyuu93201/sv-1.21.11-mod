# Whether to check for updates on server startup. Strongly Recommended.
# Default: true
check_update: true

# Whether to have specific permissions for each mob.
# For example, players won't be able to pick up a creeper unless they have
# BOTH "clickmobs.pickup" and "clickmobs.pickup.creeper" permissions.
# - Whitelisted mobs will still be able to be picked up without a mob-specific permission.
# - Blacklisted mobs will not be able to be picked up even with a mob-specific permission.
# Default: false
per_mob_permissions: false

# Whether dispensers can dispense picked up mobs.
# Default: true
enable_dispensers: true

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# In the following section you can whitelist/blacklist mobs.
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# To whitelist/blacklist a vanilla mob, add its entity name.
#     i.E: "creeper" or "ender_dragon"
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# You can also use tags (predicates) to whitelist/blacklist mobs with certain properties.
# Available tags are:
#     ?all, ?hostile, ?baby, ?tamed, ?nametagged, ?silent, ?mob
# 
# You can (optionally) pass arguments to certain tags:
#     - ?nametagged(Dinnerbone)
# You can combine multiple tags:
#     - ?tamed ?nametagged
# You can negate tags using "not":
#     - not ?hostile
# You can use the ?mob tag alongside other tags to use tags on specific mobs:
#     - ?mob(creeper, zombie) ?nametagged(Friendly!)
# You can use the ?customdata tag to target mobs added by other plugins or mobs with
# custom data. Please read the wiki for more information on this tag.
# 
# Check the wiki for more documentation on tags:
# https://clickism.de/docs/clickmobs/tags
# ---------------------------------------------------------

# Mobs that are allowed to be picked up.
# The whitelist takes precedence over the blacklist.
# (Blacklisted mobs included in the whitelist will still be allowed)
# Default: [cow, pig, sheep]
whitelisted_mobs:
- cow
- pig
- sheep

# Mobs that are not allowed to be picked up.
# Default: [?hostile, wither, ender_dragon]
blacklisted_mobs:
- ?hostile
- wither
- ender_dragon

# Items that prevent picking up mobs when held in hand.
# Use the item names (material names) of the items.
# 
# Harnesses are always blocked for Happy Ghast compatibility
# and do not need to be added here.
# 
# Use the tag "?all" to block all items. This will make it so players
# can only pick up mobs with an empty hand.
# Default: [lead, saddle]
blacklisted_items_in_hand:
- lead
- saddle

# Set a custom model data for the picked up mobs.
# This is useful for resource packs that want to change the model/texture of picked up mobs.
# Value 0 will not change the model.
custom_model_data:
  creeper: 0
  skeleton: 0
